      <h2>Budgeting App</h2>
    </a>
    <div>This was my first app, it's honestly not that good. I wanted to try out react/expo.
      The app basically keeps track of all your money and is a simple calculator for making a budget. I lost interest
      in this app because I wanted to switch to Android Studio. Maybe I will come back to fix it one day.

    <a href="../index.html">
      <h2>My Website</h2>
    </a>
    <div>The website your currently on is also part of my projects, I thought it would be a cool way to show
      my work and give information about me to help me excel in a future career.
    </div>
    <h1>WIP Projects:</h1>
    <a href="https://github.com/Dminx1234/Tower-Defense">
      <h2>Tower Defense Game</h2>
    </a>
    <div>I am exploring Unity and attempting to make a rouge-like tower defense game. I have not set a title of it just
      yet.
    </div>
    <a href="projects.html">
      <h2>Message Me</h2>
    </a>
    <div>This project will be a messager app for people to connect.
    </div>
    <a href="projects.html">
      <h2>Places</h2>
    </a>
    <div>This project will eventually be an app where you can use a googles map and mark down cool places you have been
      and
      you don't want to forget. Or maybe you want to remind yourself that the food at a restraunt was awful at a certain
      place.
